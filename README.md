# News App

This is a simple news application built with vanilla JavaScript that fetches and displays news articles using the NewsData.io API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have an API key from NewsData.io. If the application doesn't work, it might be due to an invalid API key.

### How to Obtain an API Key

2. After signing up, you can obtain your API key from your dashboard.
3. Copy the API key.

### Replacing the API Key

1. In the project directory, locate the `script.js` file where the API key is used.
2. Open `script.js` and replace the existing API key with the one you obtained from NewsData.io.
